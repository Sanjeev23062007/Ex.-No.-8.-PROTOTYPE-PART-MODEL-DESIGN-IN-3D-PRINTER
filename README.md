### DATE: 20/05/2025
## AIM: 
### To prototype the given part model design in 3D Printer.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### ●	3D Printer machine.
### ●	CURA 4.0 Software.
### ●	Autodesk Fusion 360 Software.
### ●	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

### Step 1:- Check all Electrical connections.

### Step 2:- First we install the software related the 3D printer (idea maker, ultimaker etc.)In idea maker first open the software and click the open file option as shown in below figure.

### Step 7.:- After generating the gcode format then follow the these instruction as shown in below figure.
###   1.	Switch on the 3d printer.
###   2.	Place your Pen drive in USB.
###   3.	Clean the surface bed plate.
###   4.	Load filament into the required extruder as per the requirement.
###   5.	Wait until the nozzle & bed plate comes into the required temperature.
###   6.	Close the doors of the 3d printer.
###   7.	Open the file from the USB storage and select the Print option.

## Output:
![445440213-8129a18e-93d0-46d2-9948-d6198d0a3848](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed2a27e9-a951-4349-9fcf-612afa9fad80)
